# PROJECT: SafeSentinel (SafeTransfer Protocol)

## 🎯 Vision
A specialized safety layer for Web3 transfers that prevents user errors (Network Mismatch, Honeypots, Scams) through deterministic logic (Gatekeeper) and AI-driven mentorship (Humanizer).

## 💡 Core Value
"Don't lose your funds to a network mismatch ever again."

## 🎭 Personas
- **The Architect:** Governing the system design (Currently Me).
- **The Gatekeeper:** Performing deterministic security checks.
- **The Humanizer:** Translating technical risks into real-world metaphors (Mentor Friend).
- **The Engineer:** Implementing the core Python/FastAPI logic.
- **The QA:** Verifying the mentorship quality and security.
